# About Tauchain

## What is Tau?
Tau is a decentralized blockchain network intended to solve the bottlenecks inherent in large scale human communication and accelerate productivity in human collaboration using logic based Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, large scale discussions and collaborative efforts carried out directly between people are highly inefficient. To address this problem, we developed a paradigm which we call Human-Machine-Human communication: the core principle is that the users can not only interact with each other but also make their statements clear to their Tau client. Our paradigm enables Tau to deduce areas of consensus among its users in real time, allowing the network to boost communication by acting as an intermediary between humans. It does so by collecting the opinions and preferences its users wish to share and logically constructing opinions into a semantic knowledge base.

Able to deduce consensus and understand discussions, Tau can automatically generate and execute code on consensus basis, through a process known as code synthesis. This will greatly accelerate knowledge production and expedite most large scale collaborative efforts we can imagine in today's world.

## Who created Tau?

Tau is the brainchild of Israeli developer and mathematician Ohad Asor. Ohad has been working at top tech companies in Israel since 1995. He was the youngest university student in Israel to graduate with Mathematics and Computer Science degrees. Over the years he has accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in programming and various areas of math, with a recent focus on logic, machine learning, complexity theory, philosophy of science, economics, social choice, and decentralized networks. He designed and implements Tau and Agoras. As the founder, he is currently leading the development of the project.

## What is IDNI? 

IDNI stands for Intelligent Decentralized Networks Initiatives, and it is the organization behind Tauchain.
